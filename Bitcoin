What makes currency useful:
    Scarce - there is a limited quantity of it.  It cannot be counterfeited.
    Transferable - it can be recognized and passed from person to person.



Two models:
    Cash - stands on its own, the document itself is the value.
    Check - needs verification.  the document is a



Various forms of digital cash

En - dorse?
    - Have you ever endorsed a check to someone?

Alice and Bob go public
    - People can use a mathematical algorithm to generate a pair of numbers.  As long as the numbers obey a few mathematical laws, they can form a key pair
    - The key pair has a private part, which is held by the "owner" of the key
    - The key pair has a public part, which is given out to the world
    - The keypair is just a set of numbers.  Nothing dictates that it has a "name" or anything.
    - The only thing that makes a given public key special is that someone has its associated private key.
    - But this means that each public key is an "identity" of sorts.
    - With this scheme, Alice can sign over money to another public key.  A digital check is formed

Digital clearing
    - How does "everybody" process a check?
    - Everybody can see how much a public key (a.k.a address) has received in the past, so everybody just decrements one address and increments the other.
    - Easy as pie.
    
But not really
    - Transactions have to be ordered.  What if Alice has 50 BTC and signed two checks for 50 BTC nearly simultaneously? First one wins.  Who's first?

We made a hash of it
    - Input: any integer (or message)
    - Output: a n-bit integer
    - Deterministic
    - Unpredictable

One linked list to rule them all
    - People can generate announce new "blocks" all the time.  Since you can create blocks on any previous block, you'll have more of a linked tree than a linked list.

Sir Hashalot
    - Demonstrate what "lowest" would mean
    - Nonces are extra data thrown in to change the has
    - Mention that the difficulty is tuned (every 2016 blocks)



Bitcoin
    - Developed by Satoshi Nakamoto
    
    - Uses a "hash table" to store records of who owns what
    - The "hash table" 
    - Double spending problem
    - Uses a "proof of work" scheme to prevent 

Characteristics of modern payment networks
    - Based on trust
    - Trust requires that payments be delayed
    - It is hard for parties to sign up without forming a relationship with their counterparty

Previous digital currencies
    - 

Characteristics of fiat currencies
    - Sponsored and controlled by a state
    - Security is guaranteed by the state
    - Conversely, the state may elect to tamper with the money supply
    - The state will pay its debts and demand taxes in its currency 

Double spending problem
    - Solution: trusted authority
    - 

Anonymity
    - in the sense that nobody ever attaches a name 


Independence. The security of the digital cash is not dependent on any physical location. The cash can be transferred through computer networks.
Security. The digital cash cannot be copied and reused.
Privacy (Untraceability). The privacy of the user is protected; no one can trace the relationship between the user and his purchases.
Off-line Payment. When a user pays for a purchase with electronic cash, the protocol between the user and the merchant is executed off-line. That is, the shop does not need to be linked to a host to process the user's payment.
Transferability. The digital cash can be transferred to other users.
Divisibility. A piece of digital cash in a given amount can be subdivided into smaller pieces of cash in smaller amounts. (Of course, everything has to total up properly in the end.)
